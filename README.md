# Misc-Otago-Polytechnic-Assignments
Miscellaneous assignments completed during study of the Bachelor of Information Technology at Otago Polytechnic.

## Object-oriented programming
In this first-year paper I built event-driven, GUI (Graphical User Interface) applications using pre-built controls with .NET C#. I was introduced to theoretical issues involved in Object-Oriented analysis, design and programming, and the principles of correct design and implementation for applications of this type. 

The main assignments for this paper can be found here:

* [Pacman](https://github.com/StephGarland/Misc-Otago-Polytechnic-Assignments/tree/master/Pacman)

## Java programming
In this second year paper, my object-oriented design and programming knowledge base was extended using Java. In the final two weeks there was a small assignment to make a mobile quiz in Eclipse.

## Intermediate Architectures and Algorithms 
This second year paper covered intermediate object-oriented programming concepts using .NET c++. This semester afforded me the opportunity to read a lot more code than I had previously been exposed to. This took the form of code review exercises of my peers' work, and in attempts to gain familiarity of pre-existing code bases. 

The final assignment was to write AI behaviour for a simulation of the game Ticket to Ride. After the due date, the lecturer, [Elvis](https://github.com/elvisvoer), pitted our players against each other in a tournament. My solid lil performer came out on top!

* [Nexus 2000](https://github.com/StephGarland/Misc-Otago-Polytechnic-Assignments/tree/master/Nexus-2000)
* [Ticket to Ride AI](https://github.com/StephGarland/Misc-Otago-Polytechnic-Assignments/tree/master/Ticket-to-Ride-AI-Player)

## Embedded Systems
A more hardware based paper where I programmed sensors for an Arduino. A resource manager for the Otago Polytechnic requested a mock up of a unit to be placed in classrooms that would periodically take readings from a variety of environmental sensors. 

The classroom sensor code can be found here:
